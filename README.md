# The Renegade Seamsmith

Built with React-bootstrap for a final module project while studying at ComputerPowerPlus (Whitecliff). We were tasked with building a frontend website using react, bootstrap, and fuffilling business requirements.  

## Getting Started  
  
Require installed prerequesties (if already installed check for updates):  
- Node.js  
- yarn or npm  
  
## To get it running  
  
1. Clone or download the code from the latest version on GitHub  
2. Using yarn or npm change directory to the file location which contains the src folder  
3. Using yarn or npm install:
 - react-bootstrap  
 - fabricjs  
 - mdbreact  
 - react-router-dom  
 - prop-types  
 - styles-components  
 - react-helmet
 - @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons  
 - @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core   
 - @fortawesome/react-fontawesome  
4. Type yarn start or npm start to bring up the development server page  
5. Open VisualStudioCode or any other code editor you like and open the folder containing the src file.  
6. You are now good to go
